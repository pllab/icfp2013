On Ubuntu, the following dependencies are required:

ghc
libghc-ansi-terminal-dev

To run the spartan test suite:

make
./Testing

To see a detailed output from running the analysis on factorial(5)
using 5-CFA:

make
./Testing factorial

To run your own programs through the abstract interpreter, you will
need to build the AST by hand. Look in ExampleLanguage.hs for the
continuation style passing syntax, and look in Testing.hs for examples
of its use (e.g. factorial_example). The only annoying aspect is that
a unique integer label must manually be provided by hand to each node
of an AST you create.

In ExampleLanguage.hs you will also find a direct-style syntax and
a CPS transform, but the CPS transform is woefully incomplete and
definitely incorrect.
